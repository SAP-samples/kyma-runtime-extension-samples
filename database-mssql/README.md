# Overview

This sample provides a mssql database configured with a sample database `DemoDB` which contains one table `Orders` populated with two rows of sample data.  The generation of the database, table and data is handled within `app/setup.sql`.  The database user and password can also be configured within the `app/init-db.sh` which should match the configuration of the secret defined within the `k8s/ÃŸdeployment.yaml`.


This sample demonstrates:

* Creating a development namespace in Kyma Runtime.
* Configuring and building a MSSQL database docker image
* Deploying a MSSQL database in Kyma runtime which includes
  * A secret containing the database user/password
  * A PersistentVolumeClaim for the storage of the database data
  * A deployment of the MSSQL image with the secret and PersistentVolumeClaim configuration
  * A service to expose the database to other Kubernetes resources

## Prerequisites
* SAP Cloud Platform Extension Factory, Kyma Runtime instance
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
* `kubectl` is configured to `KUBECONFIG` downloaded from Kyma Runtime.

## Deploying the database

* Create a new Namespace `dev`

```shell script
kubectl create namespace dev
``` 

* Build and push the image to your docker repository.
  
```shell script
docker build -t {your-docker-account}/mssql -f docker/Dockerfile .
docker push {your-docker-account}/mssql
```

* Appy the deployment.

```shell script
kubectl -n dev apply -f ./k8s/deployment.yaml
```

* Verify the Pod is up and running

```shell script
kubectl -n dev get po
```

You should see the pod for deployment `mssql` running.

```shell script
NAME                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
mssql-deployment-6df65c689d-nf9dk        2/2     Running   0          93s
```
