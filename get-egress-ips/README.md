# Overview

This sample contains utility script to get the Egress IPs of SAP BTP Kyma Runtime cluster. Kyma cluster is deployed in a minimal of 3 availability zones.

You might need Egress IPs for various allow-listing configurations when connecting to backing or DB Services such as SAP HANA Cloud, PostgreSQL on SAP BTP, hyperscaler option or any other third-party service which requires allow-listing.

The script intelligently runs the curl pod in each of the different availability zones to get the Egress IPs.
