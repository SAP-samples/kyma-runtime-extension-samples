# This file configures the SAP Cloud SDK Continuous Delivery pipeline of your project.
# For a reference of the configuration concept and available options, please have a look into its documentation.
#
# The documentation for the most recent pipeline version can always be found at:
#    https://github.com/SAP/cloud-s4-sdk-pipeline/blob/master/configuration.md
# If you are using a fixed version of the pipeline, please make sure to view the corresponding version from the tag
# list of GitHub (e.g. "v15" when you configured pipelineVersion = "v15" in the Jenkinsfile).
#
# For general information on how to get started with Continuous Delivery, visit:

#
# We aim to keep the pipeline configuration as stable as possible. However, major changes might also imply breaking
# changes in the configuration. Before doing an update, please check the release notes of all intermediate releases
# and adapt this file if necessary.

# This is a YAML-file. YAML is an indentation-sensitive file format. Please make sure to properly indent changes to it.
