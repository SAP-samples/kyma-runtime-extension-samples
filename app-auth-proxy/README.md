# App Reverse Proxy with OIDC Authentication Middleware

## Overview

This sample provides a reverse proxy feature which dispatches requests to other microservices running in Kyma. It includes a middleware to handle authentication which is based on Open ID Connect and can be configured using XSUAA or SAP IAS. The authentication middleware creates a server side session which is referenced by a cookie provided to the client. It also includes a middleware to validate user scopes based on HTTP methods. By default the app will use a memory store for storing user sessions which is meant for development only. It also contains a Redis implementation for storing session which is the preferred usage. See [store-implementations](https://github.com/gorilla/sessions#store-implementations) for other options.

This sample demonstrates how to:

- Create a development Namespace in the Kyma runtime.
- Consume the SCP service XSUAA
- Deploy the following Kubernetes resources:
  - API deployment written in GO
  - API Rule
  - Service
  - Configmap
  - ServiceBinding
  - ServiceBindingUsage

## Prerequisites

- SAP BTP, Kyma runtime instance
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) configured to use the `KUBECONFIG` file downloaded from the Kyma runtime

## Steps

### Create XSUAA Service Instance

1. Create a new `dev` Namespace:

   ```shell script
   kubectl create namespace dev
   ```

2. Open the file `k8s/xsuaa-instance.yaml` and adjust the value `<cluster domain>` and then apply the file

   ```shell script
   kubectl -n dev apply -f ./k8s/xsuaa-instance.yaml
   ```

3. Once the instance is provisioned choose the menu option `Service Management -> BTP Service Bindings` within the `dev` namespace.
4. Choose the `Secret` which should display the instance secret in a dialog. Choose `Decode` to view the values. These will be needed if running the sample locally.

### Run the API locally

1. Optionally set the environment variables required to connect with the XSUAA instance which can be found in the `Secret` generated with the service instance:

   ```shell script
   export IDP_clientid='<instance clientid>'
   export IDP_clientsecret=<instance clientsecret>
   export IDP_url=<instance url>
   export IDP_xsappname=<xsappname>
   ```

2. Adjust the config.json which contains the following properties. The provided `config.json` is configured to use the examples

   - [React frontend MS SQL](../frontend-react-mssql/README.md)
     - Requires the configmap API_URL to point to `https://app-auth-proxy.<cluster domain>`
   - [Golang MS SQL database API](../api-mssql-go/README.md)

3. Run the application:

   ```shell script
   go run ./cmd/proxy
   ```

4. Accessible endpoints include
   - http://localhost:8000/
   - http://localhost:8000/auth/user
   - http://localhost:8000/auth/groups

### Build the Docker image

1. Build and push the image to your Docker repository:

   ```shell script
   docker build -t {your-docker-account}/app-auth-proxy -f docker/Dockerfile .
   docker push {your-docker-account}/app-auth-proxy
   ```

2. To run the image locally adjust the config.json and either set the env variables individually, or copy them from your environment:

   ```shell script
     docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-file ./env.list --mount type=bind,source=$(pwd)/config/config.json,target=/app/config/config.json -d jcawley5/app-auth-proxy:latest
     OR
     docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-file <(env | grep IDP) --mount type=bind,source=$(pwd)/config/config.json,target=/app/config/config.json -d jcawley5/app-auth-proxy:latest
   ```

### Deploy the APP

1. Create a new `dev` Namespace:

   ```shell script
   kubectl create namespace dev
   ```

2. Within `./k8s/configmap.yaml` adjust the values and then apply the ConfigMap:

   ```shell script
   kubectl -n dev apply -f ./k8s/configmap.yaml
   ```

3. Get the name of the ServiceInstance:

   ```shell script
   kubectl -n dev get serviceinstances
   ```

   For example:

   | NAME                   | CLASS                     | PLAN        | STATUS | AGE |
   | ---------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------- | ------ | --- |
   | **_xsuaa-showy-yard_** | ClusterServiceClass/xsuaa | application | Ready  | 63m |

4. Within `./k8s/deployment.yaml` adjust the value of `<Service Instance Name>` to the XSUAA service instance name and the apply the Deployment:

   ```shell script
   kubectl -n dev apply -f ./k8s/deployment.yaml
   ```

5. Apply the APIRule:

   ```shell script
   kubectl -n dev apply -f ./k8s/apirule.yaml
   ```

6. Verify that the Deployment is up and running:

   ```shell script
   kubectl -n dev get deployment app-auth-proxy
   ```

7. Use the APIRule `https://app-auth-proxy.{cluster-domain}`
