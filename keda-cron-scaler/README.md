# SAP BTP, Kyma Runtime: Use KEDA Module Capabilities for Efficient and Cost-Effective Scaling

SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP), Kyma runtime is currently in the process of undergoing a pivotal change as it transitions to a modular architecture. This transformation will provide customers with the advantage of a la carte selection of components or capabilities, thereby reducing unnecessary overhead and complexity. One of the first modules to emerge within this novel framework is KEDA (Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling).

## Introduction to KEDA

[KEDA](https://keda.sh/), an open-source initiative that facilitates event-driven autoscaling for Kubernetes workloads, was originally developed by Microsoft and Red Hat. It has since become a sandbox project under the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). KEDA focuses on autoscaling applications in response to events sourced from a variety of platforms, including Kafka, RabbitMQ, and cloud-specific services such as Azure Service Bus and Google Pub/Sub.

### The Benefits of KEDA

KEDA ushers in a new era of flexibility and efficiency in autoscaling. It enhances Kubernetes' capacity to support fine-grained autoscaling for event-driven workloads. Leveraging KEDA, you can dynamically scale your deployments from zero to any arbitrary number, contingent on the volume of events they are designed to process.

### Activating the KEDA Module in SAP BTP, Kyma Runtime

You can activate KEDA like any other module by adhering to the official guidelines on how to [enable and disable a module](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/enable-and-disable-kyma-module).

### KEDA's Cron-Based Scaler

KEDA offers a broad range of scaling strategies, one of which is the **cron-based scaler**. This scaler allows you to schedule scaling actions according to the time of day, an invaluable feature for managing predictable fluctuations in workload.

As an illustration, the cron-based scaler enables you to:

- **Manage High Traffic and Request Volume Peaks**: With the cron-based scaler, you can program your applications to upscale during peak hours or high-traffic events, such as Black Friday or New Year sales. The same functionality can be used to schedule your applications to upscale during off-peak hours for batch processing tasks.

- **Optimize Resource Utilization and Reduce Expenses**: The cron-based scaler offers a solution to optimize resource utilization and reduce costs by allowing you to schedule your applications to downscale during non-working hours. This feature is useful for your **dev/stage/QA** clusters, which are not required during off-working hours.

  > **Note:** This benefits when your workloads require more resources than the base setup. The [current base setup](https://kyma-project.github.io/price-calculator/) consists of 3 VMs, each with 4 CPU and 16 GB of RAM. Therefore, if your workloads need 4 or more VMs to be provisioned, this feature can provide benefits to control costs and keep them to base setup during off-work hours.

  > **Note:** The cron scheduling is applicable to only customer workloads and **not kyma components**.

## Context

Let's put the cron-based scaler into action and assume we have a **development cluster** where we want to run customer workloads only during work hours, namely, **Monday - Friday, 8 AM to 6 PM**.

## Prerequisites

- [SAP BTP, Kyma runtime instance](../prerequisites/#kyma)
- [Kubernetes tooling](../prerequisites/#kubernetes)
- [KEDA and Serverless Modules enabled in Kyma](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/enable-and-disable-kyma-module)

## Procedure

1. Export your namespace's name as an environment variable.

  ```shell
  export NS={your-namespace}
  ```

2. Create the namespace. If you haven't done so already, enable Istio injection.

  ```shell
  kubectl create ns ${NS}
  kubectl label namespaces ${NS} istio-injection=enabled
  ```

3. Create a Function and a Deployment as sample workloads.

  ```shell
  kubectl -n ${NS} apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
  kubectl -n ${NS} apply -f k8s/function.yaml
  ```

4. Apply KEDA cron-based scaling to these workloads.

  ```shell
  kubectl -n ${NS} apply -f k8s/keda-cron-scaler.yaml
  ```

## How It Works

The KEDA `scaledobject` resource can be configured with a trigger of type `cron`. Within the cron scaler, you can specify that the workloads should only run during working hours.

```yaml
  triggers:
    - type: cron
      metadata:
        # You must use values from the IANA Time Zone Database.
        timezone: Europe/Berlin  
        # At 08:00 AM, from Monday to Friday
        start: 0 8 * * 1-5
        # At 06:00 PM, from Monday to Friday
        end: 0 18 * * 1-5
        # Your minimum replica count for the workload
        desiredReplicas: "1"
```

For each type of workload, you must specify **scaleTargetRef**.

```yaml
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: test-keda-cron-nginx
```

```yaml
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: serverless.kyma-project.io/v1alpha2
    kind: Function
    name: test-keda-cron-function
```

## View the Events

Check the events occurring at the start or end time of the trigger. In the following example, you can see KEDA scaling down the replicas:

```shell
kubectl -n ${NS} get events
```

```shell
LAST SEEN   TYPE      REASON                       OBJECT                                       MESSAGE

```

  > **Note:** Events are only available for one hour after the trigger.

## First-Hand Experience

I applied the KEDA cron scaler to all custom workloads in my Kyma cluster.

All my microservices and functions replicas were scaled down to zero.

Additionally, the number of nodes (VMs) was reduced from 4 to 3.
